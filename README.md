RECIPE: Minimal recomputation for radio astronomy
=================================================

This is version 2 of recipe which focuses on memoization. See the PASP
article: Nikolic, Small & Kettenis (2017) "Minimal Re-computation for
Exploratory Data Analysis in Astronomy".  Licensed under GPL (like the
dependency CASA).

How to install
--------------

```
export CASADIR=/home/user/p/casa-release-5.1.0-74.el7/
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
${CASADIR:? must be set}/bin/python get-pip.py
${CASADIR}/bin/pip2.7 install --upgrade setuptools
```
Then either install from GitHub
```
${CASADIR:? must be set}/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/bnikolic/recipe.git
```
OR install from internet
```
${CASADIR:? must be set}/bin/pip install --extra-index-url=https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~bn204/soft/py recipe
```


How to use
----------

The two main things to remember about how Recipe works:

1. Output will always be contained in a directory returned by the
   function (assign it to a variable!). Any explictly specified output
   will be ignored.

2. If a task modified it's input, the modified input will be in the
   output directory

```
from recipe import casatasks as c
c.importuvfits(....)
c.clean(....) 
```
